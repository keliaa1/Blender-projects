# 🎨 Blender Projects

Welcome to my 3D design collection!  
This repository showcases my creative journey in **Blender**, where I explore modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation.

## 🧩 About
Each project represents a step in my learning and experimentation process — from simple low-poly models to more detailed scenes.  
I aim to improve my workflow and visual storytelling through consistent practice and iteration.

## 🗂️ Projects
- **House model** – experimenting with geometry and stylized landscapes  
- **3D Car Model** – testing metallic materials and reflections  
- **Robot model** – learning proportions and facial detail  
- **Product Render** – focused on realistic lighting setups  

## 🧠 Tools & Skills
- Blender (Modeling, Shading, Rendering, Animation)
- Cycles / Eevee
- Material Nodes
- Lighting & Composition
- Git + Git LFS for version control

## 🪶 Notes
I commit regularly to track progress and share improvements over time.  
Feel free to explore the `.blend` files and renders to see how my work evolves!
